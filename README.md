# Activity Analysis throughout the day using wearables (Step Counting and Walking Detection)

Activate2 Dataset consisting of Day-Long Recordings stored in CSV Folder 

A dataset for analyzing activity throughout the day with wearables.

To run the experiment, simply clone this repository and execute the exp.py script:

> python exp.py <kbd>Return</kbd>

# Organisation

* `_CSV` contains the dataframes for 27 Participants from 001 to 033
* `_Fig` contains the plots of accelerometer values, steps, walking, and steps/min for all the participants
* `_Pkl` contains the Pkl files of the dataframes

## Step Detection and Walking Detection Consists of 4 Steps:

1. Modules and Repository Import
2. Class and Function Declarations
3. Data Exploration and Analysis
4. Data Visualization

The main functions are declared and explained in the second step. Optimal parameters are used to detect the step.

The python notebook `StepWalkingDetection.ipynb` can be found in the repository.
